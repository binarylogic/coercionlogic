= Coercionlogic

Extremely simple module to coerce blank strings into nil objects for ActiveRecord to create consistency in your database data. It keeps you from having to write query conditions like:

  name = '' OR name IS NULL

This library is part of my attempt to start pulling out common code in my applications and sharing them via gems.
